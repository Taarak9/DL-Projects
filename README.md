## Linear Classifier          
Aeroplane Classification using Linear Classifier with two variants
* Perceptron learning rule; mode = online learning, loss fn =  MSE
* Gradient descent; mode = batch learning, loss fn = Cross Entropy

## Hopfield Neural Network   
Distorted Character Recognition using Hopfield Neural Network  

## Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
* mnist_loader.py - splits MNIST data
* [src/FNN/hdr_fnn.py](https://github.com/Taarak9/Handwritten-DIgit-Recognition/blob/main/src/FNN/hdr_fnn.ipynb) - [Feedforward Neural Network](https://github.com/Taarak9/Neural-Networks/tree/master/Feedforward%20Neural%20Network) that recognize handwritten digits using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent with an accuracy of 97.72 %. 

### To-do list
* [ ] Extend it to EMNIST data
* [ ] Try different models
